- 👋 Hi, I’m Marketa Tomkova
- 🧬 I’m a postdoctoral researcher working in genomics, epigenomics, and the interface between computational, biological, and medical sciences.
- ♋ My main research interests lie in cancer genomics: uncovering the mechanisms of mutagenesis and the role of DNA polymerases and epigenetics in the mutational processes, as well as using this knowledge to search for cancer drivers mutations.
- 👩‍⚕️ I enjoy working on interdisciplinary projects together with computational, experimental, and clinical scientists.
- 😎 I have been involved in fun side-project from the fields of [deep-learning machine translation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18073-9), [congenital heart disease](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.867012/), and others.
